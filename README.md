## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [Python](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-python-standard-framework/wiki) Demo: Minimalist
This demo illustrates the simplest way (that Andy could think of) to build a
PureMVC application in python using wxPython as the GUI. A string in the model
is displayed in the GUI in a textfield. Anything you type gets converted to
uppercase and stored back in the model, courtesy of a command class triggered
when you hit the ENTER key in the GUI.
